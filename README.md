# [nextjs-ts-webworker-test](https://github.com/discretegames/nextjs-ts-webworker-test) ([demo site](https://nextjs-ts-webworker-test.vercel.app/))

This is a test project for getting web workers (and module web workers) written in TypeScript working in NextJS.
It tests workers that are built into the NextJS project, and ones imported from
[an NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@discretegames/nextjs-ts-webworker-package).

Head to <https://nextjs-ts-webworker-test.vercel.app> to see the result in production.  
Clone the repo, run `npm run dev`, and open <http://localhost:3000> to see the result locally.

This [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Made with NextJS 12.0.10 and React 17.0.2.
